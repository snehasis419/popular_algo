</p><h2>4 <a name="syscalls">System Calls or Bust</a>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This is the section where we get into the system calls that allow
you to access the network functionality of a Unix box.  When you call
one of these functions, the kernel takes over and does all the work for
you automagically.</p>
<p>The place most people get stuck around here is what order to call
these things in.  In that, the <b><tt>man</tt></b> pages are no use,
as you've probably discovered.  Well, to help with that dreadful
situation, I've tried to lay out the system calls in the following
sections in <i>exactly</i> (approximately) the same order
that you'll need to call them in your programs.</p>
<p>That, coupled with a few pieces of sample code here and there,
some milk and cookies (which I fear you will have to supply yourself),
and some raw guts and courage, and you'll be beaming data around the
Internet like the Son of Jon Postel!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.1 <a name="socket"><tt>socket()</tt>--Get the File Descriptor!</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I guess I can put it off no longer--I have to talk about the
<tt>socket()</tt> system call.  Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>But what are these arguments?  First,
<i><tt>domain</tt></i> should be set to
"<b><tt>AF_INET</tt></b>", just like in the <tt>struct
sockaddr_in</tt> (above.)  Next, the <i><tt>type</tt></i>
argument tells the kernel what kind of socket this is:
<b><tt>SOCK_STREAM</tt></b> or <b><tt>SOCK_DGRAM</tt></b>.
Finally, just set <i><tt>protocol</tt></i> to
"<b><tt>0</tt></b>" to have <tt>socket()</tt> choose
the correct protocol based on the <i><tt>type</tt></i>.  (Notes:
there are many more <i><tt>domain</tt></i>s than I've listed.
There are many more <i><tt>type</tt></i>s than I've listed.  See
the <tt>socket()</tt> man page.  Also, there's a "better"
way to get the <i><tt>protocol</tt></i>.  See the
<tt>getprotobyname()</tt> man page.)</p>
<p>
<tt>socket()</tt> simply returns to you a socket
descriptor that you can use in later system calls, or
<b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error.  The global variable
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> is set to the error's value (see the
<tt>perror()</tt> man page.)</p>
<p>In some documentation, you'll see mention of a mystical
"<b><tt>PF_INET</tt></b>".  This is a weird etherial beast that is
rarely seen in nature, but I might as well clarify it a bit here.  Once
a long time ago, it was thought that maybe a address family (what the
"AF" in "<b><tt>AF_INET</tt></b>" stands for) might support several
protocols that were referenced by their protocol family (what the "PF" in
"<b><tt>PF_INET</tt></b>" stands for).  That didn't happen.  Oh
well.  So the correct thing to do is to use <b><tt>AF_INET</tt></b>
in your <tt>struct sockaddr_in</tt> and <b><tt>PF_INET</tt></b>
in your call to <tt>socket()</tt>.  But practically
speaking, you can use <b><tt>AF_INET</tt></b> everywhere.  And,
since that's what W. Richard Stevens does in his book, that's what I'll
do here.</p>
<p>Fine, fine, fine, but what good is this socket?  The answer is
that it's really no good by itself, and you need to read on and make
more system calls for it to make any sense.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.2 <a name="bind"><tt>bind()</tt>--What port am I on?</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a socket, you might have to associate that socket
with a port on your local machine.  (This is commonly done if you're
going to <tt>listen()</tt> for incoming connections on a
specific port--MUDs do this when they tell you to "telnet to x.y.z port
6969".)  The port number is used by the kernel to match an incoming
packet to a certain process's socket descriptor.  If you're going to
only be doing a <tt>connect()</tt>, this may be unnecessary.
Read it anyway, just for kicks.</p>
<p>Here is the synopsis for the <tt>bind()</tt> system
call:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the socket file descriptor
returned by <tt>socket()</tt>.
<i><tt>my_addr</tt></i> is a pointer to a <tt>struct
sockaddr</tt> that contains information about your address, namely,
port and IP address.  <i><tt>addrlen</tt></i> can be set to
<tt>sizeof(struct sockaddr)</tt>.</p>
<p>Whew.  That's a bit to absorb in one chunk.  Let's have an
example:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

#define MYPORT 3490

main()
{
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in my_addr;

    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // do some error checking!

    my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;         // host byte order
    my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     // short, network byte order
    my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("10.12.110.57");
    memset(&amp;(my_addr.sin_zero), '\0', 8); // zero the rest of the struct

    // don't forget your error checking for bind():
    bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;my_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
    .
    .
    . 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>There are a few things to notice here:
<i><tt>my_addr.sin_port</tt></i> is in Network Byte Order.  So is
<i><tt>my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr</tt></i>.  Another thing to watch
out for is that the header files might differ from system to system.  To
be sure, you should check your local <b><tt>man</tt></b>
pages.</p>
<p>Lastly, on the topic of <tt>bind()</tt>, I
should mention that some of the process of getting your own IP address
and/or port can can be automated:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>    my_addr.sin_port = 0; // choose an unused port at random
    my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;  // use my IP address 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>See, by setting <i><tt>my_addr.sin_port</tt></i> to zero,
you are telling <tt>bind()</tt> to choose the port for you.
Likewise, by setting <i><tt>my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr</tt></i> to
<b><tt>INADDR_ANY</tt></b>, you are telling it to automatically
fill in the IP address of the machine the process is running on.</p>
<p>If you are into noticing little things, you might have seen that I
didn't put <b><tt>INADDR_ANY</tt></b> into Network Byte Order!
Naughty me.  However, I have inside info:
<b><tt>INADDR_ANY</tt></b> is really zero!  Zero still has zero on
bits even if you rearrange the bytes.  However, purists will point out
that there could be a parallel dimension where
<b><tt>INADDR_ANY</tt></b> is, say, 12 and that my code won't work
there.  That's ok with me:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>    my_addr.sin_port = htons(0); // choose an unused port at random
    my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);  // use my IP address 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Now we're so portable you probably wouldn't believe it.  I just
wanted to point that out, since most of the code you come across won't
bother running <b><tt>INADDR_ANY</tt></b> through
<tt>htonl()</tt>.</p>
<p>
<tt>bind()</tt> also returns <b><tt>-1</tt></b>
on error and sets <i><tt>errno</tt></i> to the error's
value.</p>
<p>Another thing to watch out for when calling
<tt>bind()</tt>: don't go underboard with your port numbers.
All ports below 1024 are RESERVED (unless you're the superuser)!  You
can have any port number above that, right up to 65535 (provided they
aren't already being used by another program.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might notice, you try to rerun a server and
<tt>bind()</tt> fails, claiming "Address already in use."
What does that mean?  Well, a bit a of socket that was connected is
still hanging around in the kernel, and it's hogging the port.  You can
either wait for it to clear (a minute or so), or add code to your
program allowing it to reuse the port, like this:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int yes=1;
	//char yes='1'; // Solaris people use this

// lose the pesky "Address already in use" error message
if (setsockopt(listener,SOL_SOCKET,SO_REUSEADDR,&amp;yes,sizeof(int)) == -1) {
    perror("setsockopt");
    exit(1);
} 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>One small extra final note about <tt>bind()</tt>:
there are times when you won't absolutely have to call it.  If you are
<tt>connect()</tt>ing to a remote machine and you don't
care what your local port is (as is the case with
<b><tt>telnet</tt></b> where you only care about the remote port),
you can simply call <tt>connect()</tt>, it'll check to see
if the socket is unbound, and will <tt>bind()</tt> it to an
unused local port if necessary.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.3 <a name="connect"><tt>connect()</tt>--Hey, you!</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Let's just pretend for a few minutes that you're a telnet
application.  Your user commands you (just like in the movie
<i>TRON</i>) to get a socket file descriptor.  You comply
and call <tt>socket()</tt>.  Next, the user
tells you to connect to "<tt>10.12.110.57</tt>"
on port "<tt>23</tt>" (the standard telnet
port.)  Yow!  What do you do now?</p>
<p>Lucky for you, program, you're now perusing the section on
<tt>connect()</tt>--how to connect to a remote host.  So
read furiously onward!  No time to lose!</p>
<p>The <tt>connect()</tt> call is as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is our friendly neighborhood socket
file descriptor, as returned by the <tt>socket()</tt> call,
<i><tt>serv_addr</tt></i> is a <tt>struct sockaddr</tt>
containing the destination port and IP address, and
<i><tt>addrlen</tt></i> can be set to
<tt>sizeof(struct sockaddr)</tt>.</p>
<p>Isn't this starting to make more sense?  Let's have an
example:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

#define DEST_IP   "10.12.110.57"
#define DEST_PORT 23

main()
{
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in dest_addr;   // will hold the destination addr

    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // do some error checking!

    dest_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;          // host byte order
    dest_addr.sin_port = htons(DEST_PORT);   // short, network byte order
    dest_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(DEST_IP);
    memset(&amp;(dest_addr.sin_zero), '\0', 8);  // zero the rest of the struct

    // don't forget to error check the connect()!
    connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;dest_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
    .
    .
    . 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Again, be sure to check the return value from
<tt>connect()</tt>--it'll return <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on
error and set the variable <i><tt>errno</tt></i>.</p>
<p>Also, notice that we didn't call <tt>bind()</tt>.
Basically, we don't care about our local port number; we only care where
we're going (the remote port).  The kernel will choose a local port for
us, and the site we connect to will automatically get this information
from us.  No worries.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.4 <a name="listen"><tt>listen()</tt>--Will somebody please call
me?</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, time for a change of pace.  What if you don't want to connect
to a remote host.  Say, just for kicks, that you want to wait for
incoming connections and handle them in some way.  The process is two
step: first you <tt>listen()</tt>, then you
<tt>accept()</tt> (see below.)</p>
<p>The listen call is fairly simple, but requires a bit of
explanation:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int listen(int sockfd, int backlog); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the usual socket file descriptor
from the <tt>socket()</tt> system call.
<i><tt>backlog</tt></i> is the number of connections allowed on
the incoming queue.  What does that mean?  Well, incoming connections
are going to wait in this queue until you <tt>accept()</tt>
them (see below) and this is the limit on how many can queue up.  Most
systems silently limit this number to about 20; you can probably get
away with setting it to <b><tt>5</tt></b> or
<b><tt>10</tt></b>.</p>
<p>Again, as per usual, <tt>listen()</tt> returns
<b><tt>-1</tt></b> and sets <i><tt>errno</tt></i> on
error.</p>
<p>Well, as you can probably imagine, we need to call
<tt>bind()</tt> before we call <tt>listen()</tt>
or the kernel will have us listening on a random port.  Bleah!  So if
you're going to be listening for incoming connections, the sequence of
system calls you'll make is:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>socket();
bind();
listen();
/* accept() goes here */ 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>I'll just leave that in the place of sample code, since it's
fairly self-explanatory.  (The code in the <tt>accept()</tt>
section, below, is more complete.)  The really tricky part of this whole
sha-bang is the call to <tt>accept()</tt>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.5 <a name="accept"><tt>accept()</tt>--"Thank you for calling port
3490."</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Get ready--the <tt>accept()</tt> call is kinda weird!
What's going to happen is this: someone far far away will try to
<tt>connect()</tt> to your machine on a port that you are
<tt>listen()</tt>ing on.  Their connection will be queued
up waiting to be <tt>accept()</tt>ed.  You call
<tt>accept()</tt> and you tell it to get the pending
connection.  It'll return to you a <i>brand new socket file
descriptor</i> to use for this single connection!  That's right,
suddenly you have <i>two socket file descriptors</i> for
the price of one!  The original one is still listening on your port and
the newly created one is finally ready to <tt>send()</tt>
and <tt>recv()</tt>.  We're there! </p>
<p>The call is as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre> #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

 int accept(int sockfd, void *addr, int *addrlen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the
<tt>listen()</tt>ing socket descriptor.  Easy enough.
<i><tt>addr</tt></i> will usually be a pointer to a local
<tt>struct sockaddr_in</tt>.  This is where the information about
the incoming connection will go (and with it you can determine which
host is calling you from which port).  <i><tt>addrlen</tt></i> is
a local integer variable that should be set to
<tt>sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)</tt> before its
address is passed to <tt>accept()</tt>.  Accept will not put
more than that many bytes into <i><tt>addr</tt></i>. If it puts
fewer in, it'll change the value of <i><tt>addrlen</tt></i> to
reflect that.</p>
<p>Guess what?  <tt>accept()</tt> returns
<b><tt>-1</tt></b> and sets <i><tt>errno</tt></i> if an
error occurs.  Betcha didn't figure that.</p>
<p>Like before, this is a bunch to absorb in one chunk, so here's a
sample code fragment for your perusal:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;

#define MYPORT 3490    // the port users will be connecting to

#define BACKLOG 10     // how many pending connections queue will hold

main()
{
    int sockfd, new_fd;  // listen on sock_fd, new connection on new_fd
    struct sockaddr_in my_addr;    // my address information
    struct sockaddr_in their_addr; // connector's address information
    int sin_size;

    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // do some error checking!

    my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;         // host byte order
    my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     // short, network byte order
    my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // auto-fill with my IP
    memset(&amp;(my_addr.sin_zero), '\0', 8); // zero the rest of the struct

    // don't forget your error checking for these calls:
    bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;my_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));

    listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);

    sin_size = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
    new_fd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;their_addr, &amp;sin_size);
    .
    .
    . 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Again, note that we will use the socket descriptor
<i><tt>new_fd</tt></i> for all <tt>send()</tt> and
<tt>recv()</tt> calls.  If you're only getting one single
connection ever, you can <tt>close()</tt> the listening
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> in order to prevent more incoming
connections on the same port, if you so desire.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.6 <a name="sendrecv"><tt>send()</tt> and <tt>recv()</tt>--Talk
to me, baby!</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>These two functions are for communicating over stream sockets or
connected datagram sockets.  If you want to use regular unconnected
datagram sockets, you'll need to see the section on <a href="http://beej.us/net2/html/syscalls.html#sendtorecv"><tt>sendto()</tt> and
<tt>recvfrom()</tt></a>, below.</p>
<p>The <tt>send()</tt> call:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the socket descriptor you want to
send data to (whether it's the one returned by
<tt>socket()</tt> or the one you got with
<tt>accept()</tt>.) <i><tt>msg</tt></i> is a pointer
to the data you want to send, and <i><tt>len</tt></i> is the
length of that data in bytes.  Just set <i><tt>flags</tt></i> to
<b><tt>0</tt></b>.  (See the <tt>send()</tt> man page
for more information concerning flags.)</p>
<p>Some sample code might be:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>char *msg = "Beej was here!";
int len, bytes_sent;
.
.
len = strlen(msg);
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
.
.
. 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<tt>send()</tt> returns the number of bytes actually
sent out--<i>this might be less than the number you told it to
send!</i>  See, sometimes you tell it to send a whole gob of data
and it just can't handle it.  It'll fire off as much of the data as it
can, and trust you to send the rest later.  Remember, if the value
returned by <tt>send()</tt> doesn't match the value in
<i><tt>len</tt></i>, it's up to you to send the rest of the
string.  The good news is this: if the packet is small (less than 1K or
so) it will <i>probably</i> manage to send the whole thing
all in one go.  Again, <b><tt>-1</tt></b> is returned on error, and
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> is set to the error number.</p>
<p>The <tt>recv()</tt> call is similar in many
respects:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the socket descriptor to read
from, <i><tt>buf</tt></i> is the buffer to read the information
into, <i><tt>len</tt></i> is the maximum length of the buffer,
and <i><tt>flags</tt></i> can again be set to
<b><tt>0</tt></b>.  (See the <tt>recv()</tt> man page
for flag information.)</p>
<p>
<tt>recv()</tt> returns the number of bytes actually
read into the buffer, or <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error (with
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> set, accordingly.)</p>
<p>Wait!  <tt>recv()</tt> can return
<b><tt>0</tt></b>.  This can mean only one thing: the remote side
has closed the connection on you!  A return value of
<b><tt>0</tt></b> is <tt>recv()</tt>'s way of letting
you know this has occurred.</p>
<p>There, that was easy, wasn't it?  You can now pass data back and
forth on stream sockets!  Whee!  You're a Unix Network
Programmer!</p>

<tt>recvfrom()</tt>--Talk to me, DGRAM-style</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>"This is all fine and dandy," I hear you saying, "but where does
this leave me with unconnected datagram sockets?"  No problemo, amigo.
We have just the thing.</p>
<p>Since datagram sockets aren't connected to a remote host, guess which
piece of information we need to give before we send a packet?  That's
right!  The destination address!  Here's the scoop:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int sendto(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags,
           const struct sockaddr *to, int tolen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>As you can see, this call is basically the same as the call to
<tt>send()</tt> with the addition of two other pieces of
information.  <i><tt>to</tt></i> is a pointer to a <tt>struct
sockaddr</tt> (which you'll probably have as a <tt>struct
sockaddr_in</tt> and cast it at the last minute) which contains the
destination IP address and port.  <i><tt>tolen</tt></i> can
simply be set to <tt>sizeof(struct
sockaddr)</tt>.</p>
<p>Just like with <tt>send()</tt>,
<tt>sendto()</tt> returns the number of bytes actually sent
(which, again, might be less than the number of bytes you told it to
send!), or <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error.</p>
<p>Equally similar are <tt>recv()</tt> and
<tt>recvfrom()</tt>.  The synopsis of
<tt>recvfrom()</tt> is:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags,
             struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Again, this is just like <tt>recv()</tt> with the
addition of a couple fields.  <i><tt>from</tt></i> is a pointer
to a local <tt>struct sockaddr</tt> that will be filled with the IP
address and port of the originating machine.
<i><tt>fromlen</tt></i> is a pointer to a local <tt>int</tt>
that should be initialized to <tt>sizeof(struct sockaddr)</tt>.
When the function returns, <i><tt>fromlen</tt></i> will contain
the length of the address actually stored in
<i><tt>from</tt></i>.</p>
<p>
<tt>recvfrom()</tt> returns the number of bytes
received, or <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error (with
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> set accordingly.)</p>
<p>Remember, if you <tt>connect()</tt> a datagram socket,
you can then simply use <tt>send()</tt> and
<tt>recv()</tt> for all your transactions.  The socket
itself is still a datagram socket and the packets still use UDP, but the
socket interface will automatically add the destination and source
information for you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.8 <a name="closedown"><tt>close()</tt> and
<tt>shutdown()</tt>--Get outta my face!</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Whew!  You've been <tt>send()</tt>ing and
<tt>recv()</tt>ing data all day long, and you've had it.
You're ready to close the connection on your socket descriptor.  This is
easy.  You can just use the regular Unix file descriptor
<tt>close()</tt> function:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>close(sockfd); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>This will prevent any more reads and writes to the socket.  Anyone
attempting to read or write the socket on the remote end will receive an
error.</p>
<p>Just in case you want a little more control over how the socket
closes, you can use the <tt>shutdown()</tt> function.  It
allows you to cut off communication in a certain direction, or both ways
(just like <tt>close()</tt> does.)  Synopsis:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>int shutdown(int sockfd, int how); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the socket file descriptor you
want to shutdown, and <i><tt>how</tt></i> is one of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>0</tt></b> -- Further receives are
disallowed</li>
<li>
<b><tt>1</tt></b> -- Further sends are
disallowed</li>
<li>
<b><tt>2</tt></b> -- Further sends and receives are
disallowed (like <tt>close()</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<tt>shutdown()</tt> returns <b><tt>0</tt></b> on
success, and <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error (with
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> set accordingly.)</p>
<p>If you deign to use <tt>shutdown()</tt> on unconnected
datagram sockets, it will simply make the socket unavailable for further
<tt>send()</tt> and <tt>recv()</tt> calls
(remember that you can use these if you <tt>connect()</tt>
your datagram socket.)</p>
<p>It's important to note that <tt>shutdown()</tt>
doesn't actually close the file descriptor--it just changes its
usability.  To free a socket descriptor, you need to use
<tt>close()</tt>.</p>
<p>Nothing to it.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.9 <a name="getpeername"><tt>getpeername()</tt>--Who are you?</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This function is so easy.</p>
<p>It's so easy, I almost didn't give it it's own section.  But here
it is anyway.</p>
<p>The function <tt>getpeername()</tt> will tell you who is at the other end
of a connected stream socket.  The synopsis:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int getpeername(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<i><tt>sockfd</tt></i> is the descriptor of the connected
stream socket, <i><tt>addr</tt></i> is a pointer to a
<tt>struct sockaddr</tt> (or a <tt>struct sockaddr_in</tt>) that
will hold the information about the other side of the connection, and
<i><tt>addrlen</tt></i> is a pointer to an <tt>int</tt>, that
should be initialized to <tt>sizeof(struct
sockaddr)</tt>.</p>
<p>The function returns <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error and sets
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> accordingly.</p>
<p>Once you have their address, you can use
<tt>inet_ntoa()</tt> or <tt>gethostbyaddr()</tt>
to print or get more information.  No, you can't get their login name.
(Ok, ok.  If the other computer is running an ident daemon, this is
possible.  This, however, is beyond the scope of this document.  Check
out <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt">RFC-1413</a> for more
info.)</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.10 <a name="gethostname"><tt>gethostname()</tt>--Who am I?</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Even easier than <tt>getpeername()</tt> is the
function <tt>gethostname()</tt>.  It returns the name of the
computer that your program is running on.  The name can then be used by
<tt>gethostbyname()</tt>, below, to determine the IP address
of your local machine.</p>
<p>What could be more fun?  I could think of a few things, but they
don't pertain to socket programming.  Anyway, here's the
breakdown:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>The arguments are simple: <i><tt>hostname</tt></i> is a
pointer to an array of chars that will contain the hostname upon the
function's return, and <i><tt>size</tt></i> is the length in
bytes of the <i><tt>hostname</tt></i> array.</p>
<p>The function returns <b><tt>0</tt></b> on successful
completion, and <b><tt>-1</tt></b> on error, setting
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> as usual.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p><h3>4.11 <a name="dns">DNS--You say "whitehouse.gov", I say "198.137.240.92"</a>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In case you don't know what DNS is, it stands for "Domain Name
Service".  In a nutshell, you tell it what the human-readable address is
for a site, and it'll give you the IP address (so you can use it with
<tt>bind()</tt>, <tt>connect()</tt>,
<tt>sendto()</tt>, or whatever you need it for.)  This way,
when someone enters:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>$ <b><tt>telnet whitehouse.gov</tt></b>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>
<b><tt>telnet</tt></b> can find out that it needs to
<tt>connect()</tt> to "198.137.240.92".</p>
<p>But how does it work?  You'll be using the function
<tt>gethostbyname()</tt>:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name); 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>As you see, it returns a pointer to a <tt>struct hostent</tt>,
the layout of which is as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>struct hostent {
    char    *h_name;
    char    **h_aliases;
    int     h_addrtype;
    int     h_length;
    char    **h_addr_list;
};
#define h_addr h_addr_list[0] 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>And here are the descriptions of the fields in the <tt>struct
hostent</tt>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><tt>h_name</tt></i> -- Official name of the
host.</li>
<li>
<i><tt>h_aliases</tt></i> -- A NULL-terminated
array of alternate names for the host.</li>
<li>
<i><tt>h_addrtype</tt></i> -- The type of address
being returned; usually
<i><tt>AF_INET</tt></i>.</li>
<li>
<i><tt>h_length</tt></i> -- The length of the
address in bytes.</li>
<li>
<i><tt>h_addr_list</tt></i> -- A zero-terminated
array of network addresses for the host.  Host addresses are in Network
Byte Order.</li>
<li>
<i><tt>h_addr</tt></i> -- The first address in
<i><tt>h_addr_list</tt></i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<tt>gethostbyname()</tt> returns a pointer to the
filled <tt>struct hostent</tt>, or NULL on error.  (But
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> is <i>not</i>
set--<i><i><tt>h_errno</tt></i></i> is set instead.
See <tt>herror()</tt>, below.)</p>
<p>But how is it used?  Sometimes (as we find from reading computer
manuals), just spewing the information at the reader is not enough.
This function is certainly easier to use than it looks.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/%7Ebeej/guide/net/examples/getip.c">Here's an example
program</a>:</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td bgcolor="#cfcfcf">
<pre>/*
** getip.c -- a hostname lookup demo
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct hostent *h;

    if (argc != 2) {  // error check the command line
        fprintf(stderr,"usage: getip address\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    if ((h=gethostbyname(argv[1])) == NULL) {  // get the host info
        herror("gethostbyname");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Host name  : %s\n", h-&gt;h_name);
    printf("IP Address : %s\n", inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)h-&gt;h_addr)));
   
   return 0;
} 
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>With <tt>gethostbyname()</tt>, you can't use
<tt>perror()</tt> to print error message (since
<i><tt>errno</tt></i> is not used).  Instead, call
<tt>herror()</tt>.</p>
<p>It's pretty straightforward.  You simply pass the string that
contains the machine name ("whitehouse.gov") to
<tt>gethostbyname()</tt>, and then grab the information out
of the returned <tt>struct hostent</tt>.</p>
<p>The only possible weirdness might be in the printing of the IP
address, above.  <i><tt>h-&gt;h_addr</tt></i> is a
<tt>char*</tt>, but <tt>inet_ntoa()</tt> wants a
<tt>struct in_addr</tt> passed to it.  So I cast
<i><tt>h-&gt;h_addr</tt></i> to a <tt>struct in_addr*</tt>,
then dereference it to get at the data.</p>
